        Geothermal energy has numerous advantages. Itâ€™s reliable and not intermittent due to weather and provides power generation and electrical grid stability 24/7, 365 days a year. Most importantly, geothermal power is dispatchable, meaning it does not require battery storage, unlike other renewable forms of energy.
