        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong> 11.1 Digital Assets May Lose Value.</strong> You have
          carefully reviewed, acknowledge, understand and assume the following
          risks, as well as all other risks associated with digital assets
          (including those not discussed herein), all of which could render your
          digital assets worthless or of little value.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> 11.2 Your Sole Risk.</strong> Investing in digital assets is
          at your sole risk and any digital assets purchased are provided, used
          and acquired on an “AS IS” and on an “AS AVAILABLE” basis without
          representations, warranties, promises or guarantees whatsoever of any
          kind by Company. You must rely on your own examination and
          investigation thereof.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> 11.3 Purchase Price Risk.</strong> There are no guarantees as
          to the price of digital assets purchased by you and no guarantees that
          the price per digital assets determined by the market will be equal to
          or higher than your purchase price. There is the possibility that the
          price per digital assets may fall below the price paid by you.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> 11.4 Ability to Transact or Resell.</strong> You may be
          unable to sell or otherwise transact in digital assets at any time, or
          for the price you paid due to (a) diminution in value of the digital
          assets; (b) lack of liquidity for the digital assets; or (c)
          restrictions on the transferability of the digital assets.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> 11.5 Regulatory Framework.</strong> Our technology may be
          used worldwide. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental
          authorities may regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult
          to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes
          to existing laws, regulations or rules that may affect our technology
          and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact digital
          assets in various ways, including, for example, through a
          determination that digital assets are a regulated financial instrument
          that requires registration.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> 11.6 Risk of Government Action.</strong> The digital asset
          industry is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and
          scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can
          be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine the
          operations of digital assets or pursue enforcement actions against
          digital assets.{" "}

        <p>
          Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your

          <strong> (A). Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. </strong> All
          claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other
          equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or
          the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot
          be resolved informally shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an
          individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless
          otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in
          English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company,
          and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors
          in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or
          unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided

            (B). Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.
          </strong>{" "}
          Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to
          the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the
          nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A
          Notice to the Company should be sent to: 16107 Kensington Drive, #116,
          Sugar Land, Texas 77479. After the Notice is received, you and the
          Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you
          and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30)
          days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
          arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any
          party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
          arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which
          either party is entitled.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> (c). Arbitration Rules. </strong> Arbitration shall be
          initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an
          established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”)
          that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not
          available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an
          alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern
          all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the
          method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the
          extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer
          Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are
          available online at www.adr.org or by calling AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
          The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.
          Arbitration proceedings will be held in Houston, Texas. Any claims or
          disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten
          Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
          non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking
          relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award
          sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right
          to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any judgment
          on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
          competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including
          attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and
          shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> (E). Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursue
          arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded
          within the statute of limitations (i.e.,the legal deadline for filing
          a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the
          pertinent claim.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> (F). Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is
          initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if
          any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated
          with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The
          arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of
          all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
          award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
          available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and
          the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
          decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which
          the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
          The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual
          basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the
          arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.

          TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims
          and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration
          Agreement. In the event any litigation should arise between you and
          the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or
          enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE

          CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE

          arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a
          waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration
