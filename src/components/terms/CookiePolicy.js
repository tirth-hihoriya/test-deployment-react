          This cookie policy (“Policy”) describes how HYDROGEN196 INC., a
          Delaware corporation (together with its affiliates, (the “Company”)
          uses technologies known as cookies, pixels, beacons, device
          information and local storage to deliver and understand your use of
          Company Services, including insights into member behavior, so we can
          improve our communications, products and services. We also use these
          technologies for security purposes and measurement. Third parties
          (e.g. developers) that you interact with as you use the Service may
          also use these technologies for a variety of purposes. We aim to be
          transparent about how these technologies are useful to you, others and
          us. Because cookies are used to provide you with the Service,
          disabling them may prevent you from using the Service.

          Like most similar websites, the website located at
          www.geothermalcore.com (the “Site”) uses cookies. By using the Site
          and agreeing to this policy, you consent to our use of cookies in
          accordance with the terms of this policy. All collection and
          processing of personal information is done in accordance with our
          Privacy Policy.

          <strong>Cookies </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cookies are small files that are placed on your browser or device by
          the website or app you’re using. Pixel tags (also called clear GIFs,
          web beacons, or pixels) are small blocks of code on a webpage or app
          that allow us to do things like read and place cookies and transmit
          information to us or our partners. The resulting connection can
          include information such as a device’s IP address, the time a person
          viewed the pixel, an identifier associated with the browser or device
          and the type of browser being used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A
          persistent cookie consists of a text file sent that allows a website
          or app to store and retrieve data on a person’s computer, mobile phone
          or other devices. Some examples include device or HTML5 local storage
          and caching. A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the
          end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may place or use these technologies when you interact with our
          Services, whether or not you are logged in. For example, when you
          visit our website(s) or use our applications, we may place or read
          cookies or receive information from your devices. We may also place
          cookies through a pixel on a partner’s site or through developer’s
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why we use Cookies </strong>{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          We use Cookies for a variety of reasons. We use them to improve our
          Service, to make the ads you see more relevant to you, to count how
          many visitors we receive to a page, to help you sign up for our
          services, to protect your data, or to remember your advertising
          settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          While specific names of the cookies and similar technologies that we
          use may change from time to time as we improve and update our Service,
          they fall into the below categories of use:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Authentication </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          These technologies tell us when you are logged in so we can show you
          your dashboard, cards, transactions and other information about your
          account. They also give us information about your use of the Service
          that we use for a variety of reasons, including making your member
          experience better.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Security </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          These technologies help us detect potential or real abuse, Account
          compromises, multiple logins, and other activity. They help us
          determine if the browser you’re using is new and give us information
          about active sessions related to your account. These technologies can
          also help us detect abuse and violations of terms and policies that
          are in place to protect us and our members, for example, attempting to
          determine activity is automated or human - initiated.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Features </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          These technologies can help make your use of the Service smoother and
          easier by remembering the information you provided and allowing us to
          tailor your experience. For example, we may be able to store certain
          preferences or show you relevant information about your value
          exchanges or otherwise learn when you have interacted with something
          on the Service.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Advertising </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          These technologies are used to help us display advertisements on other
          platforms or on our own that may be relevant to you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Analytics </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also use the technologies for general research and to
          understand how members are using the Service and / or third - party
          applications.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Cookie Consent </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We use cookies to store your preferences in relation to the use of
          cookies more generally. If you delete this cookie, your preferences
          will not be remembered by the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Use of Cookies on Mobile Devices </strong>{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Many mobile devices contain browsers, not unlike browsers for
          computers. When applicable, we will use cookies in the same way we do
          if you are using the Service via your computer. If you consume the
          Service on devices that use local storage, Software Development Kits
          (SDKs) or Advanced Programming Interfaces (APIs), we will use these
          technologies to accomplish the same purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will use information about your device in ways consistent with the
          above and to improve the Service. We will collect and use the
          information on transactions including payment information any
          applicable account, credit or debit card number and other card
          information, and other account and authentication information relating
          to any transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          As on the web, we also may use these technologies to store an
          identifier or other information on your device. We describe how we use
          these technologies and the information we received through their use
          above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Reading Cookies </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Web browsers send any cookies for a particular web domain to the
          website each time a device with those cookies accesses content served
          from that domain. This means that any geothermalcore.com cookie will
          be sent to us when any page is accessed at geothermalcore.com by that
          device. It also means that these cookies are sent to us when someone
          accesses a third-party website or application that integrates or uses
          our Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may work with partners so that we can place or read cookies on your
          browsers or devices when you visit third-party services. This allows
          us to do things like read and reference cookies from more than one
          device or browser that you use, on and off of our Service, so we can
          provide you with consistent service across all of your devices and
          improve and understand your experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Third Party Cookies </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We sometimes use third parties in connection with the Service,
          including analytics providers, advertising networks, and developers of
          applications that you can access through our platform. They may use a
          pixel to collect information about your device so that they or we can
          identify you. If you authorize an application on our platform, their
          developers may also use cookies, pixels or similar technologies (like
          local storage or information from your device), to help provide you
          with relevant services. For example, a developer or platform partner
          may use cookies, software developer kits (SDKs) or similar
          technologies to customize your experience while you’re using their
          app. Developers or our partners also may use these technologies to
          help share information with us, like how you use their website or
          application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those developing on our Platform may collect information when you view
          or use them, including information about you and your device or
          browser. They may do this using cookies or similar technologies. We
          require developers to be transparent about what they collect and how
          they use the information. To learn more about the information they
          collect or receive, please review their privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Control of Cookie Settings </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Your browser or device may offer settings related to these
          technologies, including how to delete or block them. For more
          information about whether these settings are available, what they do,
          and how they work, visit your browser or device's help material. If
          you disable certain settings, we may not be able to recognize or
          respond to browser or device information, and that may interfere with
          your use of the Service or certain features of the Service.
